    /* Threading
     We discussed a potential threading model that might be used.
     LDClient runs on the main thread.
     FF value requests are handled in whatever thread the client app makes the request
     FF sse/polling & update requests run in a LDClient launched bg thread instantiated at creation
     Event processing runs in a LDClient launched bg thread instantiated at creation
    */
    
    // MARK: - Feature Flag Updates
    /* Notification
     There are potentially 3 models LDClient could use to notify client apps when FF changes occur
     A. Notifications. LDClient posts a notification via NotificationCenter. Listeners then request flags from LDClient.
     B. Closures. LDClient registers closures to execute on FF change.
     C. Delegation. LDClient calls delegate method on FF change.
     
     Each has merit, and perhaps for flexibility, we should implement all 3. That gives client apps max flexibility for code style.
     
     Regardless of the method, a set of flag keys indicating the changed flags should be sent. The client app can then use the changed flag keys to decide whether to request an update from the LDClient. Note: I don't think the updated flag value should be included. While that forces the client app to request the update from the LDClient, it also preserves the LDClient as the source of truth for the system...
     LDClient should only invoke the notification method when it is running.

    ///Client apps may listen for LDClient.featureFlagUpdatedNotificationName notifications
    
    ///Client apps may set a closure to be called when feature flags are updated. If the handler is set when start(config: user:) is called, LDClient will execute the handler on receipt of the flags from the server (not when flags are retrieved from the cache, if available)
    //TODO: Should LDClient accept multiple handlers? (The idea would be to then hide this and provide a method setFeatureFlagUpdate(handler: forKey:)

    ///Client apps may set a delegate which LDClient will call when feature flags are updated.

    /* FF Value Requests
     Arun prefers to maintain the naming convention <type>Variation(key:)-><type> for the flag getters. These names are used in the other SDKs.
     The LDClient should also provide an allFlags method -> [String: Any]
     Internally, the LDClient should maintain a [String: Any] for flags. Flag requests should respond using this structure.
     Additionally, some metadata about the flag dictionary should be maintained about it's source (server, cache)
     At start, the LDClient should load the cached user's flags and ask the flag processor to request an update and start monitoring (sse/poll)
     What should the LDClient do if it is instantiated but not started, and a client app requests a flag value?
