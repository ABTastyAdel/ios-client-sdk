    ///NOTE: If the LDClient is online, there may be a brief delay before an update to the feature flags is available, depending upon network conditions. Prior to receiving a feature flag update, LDClient will return cached feature flags if they are available. If no cached feature flags are available, the LDClient will return fallback values. 
    ///If a client app wants to be notified when the LDClient receives the updated user flags, pass in a completion closure. The LDClient will call the closure once after the first feature flag update from the LD server, passing in the value of allFeatureFlags.

If the client is offline, the closure will not be called until the app sets the client online and the client has received the first flag update from the LD server.

    /* Event tracking
     Conceptual model
     The LDClient appears to keep an event dictionary that it transmits periodically to LD. An app sends an event and optional data by calling trackEvent(key:, data:) supplying at least the key.

    ///Usage:   client.trackEvent(key: "app-event-key", data: appEventData)

    // MARK: Feature Flag values
    
    /* FF Value Requests
     Conceptual Model
     The LDClient is the focal point for flag value requests. It should appear to the app that the client contains a store of [key: value] pairs where the keys are all strings and the values any of the supported LD flag types (Bool, number (int, float), String, Array, Dictionary). The LDFlaggable protocol defines the LD supported flag types.
     When asked for allFeatureFlags, the LDClient should provide a [String: LDFlaggable] with keys & values. Nil values should not appear in this dictionary...it would be the same as if the key weren't there.
     When asked for a variation value, the LDClient provides either the LDFlaggable value, or a (LDFlaggable, LDVariationSource) that reports the value and value source.
     
     At launch, the LDClient should ask the LDUserCache to load the cached user's flags (if any) and then ask the flag synchronizer to start synchronizing (via streaming / polling)

    ///Usage: let flags = client.allFeatureFlags
    public var allFeatureFlags: [String: LDFlaggable] {
        return user.allFlags
    }

    ///Usage
    /// flagValue = client.variation("flag-key", fallback: false)
    public func variation<T>(_ forKey: String, fallback: T) -> T where T: LDFlaggable {
        return fallback
    }

    ///Usage
    /// (flagValue, flagValueSource) = client.variation("flag-key", fallback: false)
    public func variation<T>(_ forKey: String, fallback: T) -> (T, LDVariationSource) where T: LDFlaggable {
        return (fallback, .fallback)
    }
    
    // MARK: Feature Flag Updates
    
    /* FF Change Notification
     Conceptual Model
     LDClient keeps a list of two types of closure observers, either Individual Flag observers or All Flag observers. LDClient executes Individual Flag observers when it detects a change to that flag being observed. LDClient executes All Flag observers when it detects a change to any flag for the current LDUser. The closure has a LDChangedFlag input parameter that communicates the flag's old & new value. Individual Flag observers will have an LDChangedFlag passed into the parameter directly. All Flags observers will have a dictionary of [String: LDChangeFlag] that use the flag key as the dictionary key.
     An app registers an Individual Flag observer using observe(key:, owner:, observer:), or an All Flags observer using observeAll(owner:, observer:). An app can register multiple closures for each type by calling these methods multiple times. When the value of a flag changes, LDClient calls each registered closure 1 time.
     LDClient will automatically remove observer closures that cannot be executed. This means an app does not need to stop observing flags, the LDClient will remove the observer the next time the LDClient would have executed the observer. An app can stop observers explicitly using one of several stopObserving methods. An app can stop Individual Flag observers using stopObserving(key:, owner:), or All Flags observers using stopObservingAll(owner:). An app may also choose to stop all observers (of either type, Individual Flag or All Flags) for a given owner using stopObserver(owner:). Finally, an app can store the LDFlagObserverToken returned by the observe(key:, owner:, observer:) and observeAll(owner:, observer:) methods and then use stopObserving(token:) to stop any single observer closure. This gives an app the ability to have very precise control over the observers registered.
