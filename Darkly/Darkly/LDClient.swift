    /* Event tracking
     Conceptual model
     The LDClient appears to keep an event dictionary that it transmits periodically to LD. An app sends an event and optional data by calling trackEvent(key:, data:) supplying at least the key.

    // MARK: Feature Flag values
    
    /* FF Value Requests
     Conceptual Model
     The LDClient is the focal point for flag value requests. It should appear to the app that the client contains a store of [key: value] pairs where the keys are all strings and the values any of the supported LD flag types (Bool, number (int, float), String, Array, Dictionary). The LDFlaggable protocol defines the LD supported flag types.
     When asked for a variation value, the LDClient provides either the LDFlaggable value, or a (LDFlaggable, LDVariationSource) that reports the value and value source.
     
     At launch, the LDClient should ask the LDUserCache to load the cached user's flags (if any) and then ask the flag synchronizer to start synchronizing (via streaming / polling)

    ///Usage
    /// let boolFeatureFlagValue = LDClient.shared.variation(forKey: "bool-flag-key", fallback: false) //boolFeatureFlagValue is a Bool

        return fallback
    }

    ///Usage
    /// let (boolFeatureFlagValue, boolFeatureFlagSource) = LDClient.shared.variationAndSource(forKey: "bool-flag-key", fallback: false)    //boolFeatureFlagValue is a Bool
    public func variationAndSource<T: LDFlagValueConvertible>(forKey key: String, fallback: T) -> (T, LDFlagValueSource) {
        return (fallback, .fallback)
    }
    
    // MARK: Feature Flag Updates
    
    /* FF Change Notification
     Conceptual Model
     LDClient keeps a list of two types of closure observers, either Individual Flag observers or All Flags observers. LDClient executes Individual Flag observers when it detects a change to that flag being observed. LDClient executes All Flags observers when it detects a change to any flag for the current LDUser. The closure has a LDChangedFlag input parameter that communicates the flag's old & new value. Individual Flag observers will have an LDChangedFlag passed into the parameter directly. All Flags observers will have a dictionary of [String: LDChangeFlag] that use the flag key as the dictionary key.
     An app registers an Individual Flag observer using observe(key:, owner:, observer:), or an All Flags observer using observeAll(owner:, observer:). An app can register multiple closures for each type by calling these methods multiple times. When the value of a flag changes, LDClient calls each registered closure 1 time.
     LDClient will automatically remove observer closures that cannot be executed. This means an app does not need to stop observing flags, the LDClient will remove the observer after it has gone out of scope. An app can stop observers explicitly using stopObserver(owner:).
